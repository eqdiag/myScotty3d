# pTrace

A physically-based path tracer based based on the stencil code for [Scotty3D](https://github.com/CMU-Graphics/Scotty3D).

Setup is described [here](https://github.com/eqdiag/myScotty3d/tree/main#readme).


# Features
- [x] Triangle Mesh and Sphere Intersections
- [x] Bounding Volume Hierachy (BVH) for Ray Acceleration
- [x] Recursive Path Tracing solution to the [Rendering Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_equation).
- [x] Support for multiple material BSDFs: Lambertian (diffuse), Perfect mirror, Dielectric (glass)
- [x] Direct light sampling to speed up convergence
- [x] Single-sample multiple-importance sampling between BSDF and direct light samples
- [x] Support for custom environment maps as light sources
